# Doodling-with-Python-3

Currently, I'm learning Python 3. Here you'll find all my "doodles", basically to practice I write simple scripts (games, tools, and etc), for practicing purposes. 

Feel free to use the code on here without crediting me, the code on here is for people to read and compare to theirs or learn, most lines of code will be explain with as comment after.

Good luck! :D

Enjoy!
